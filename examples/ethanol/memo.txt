Study on pressure dependences of ethanol oxidation by separated weak flames in a micro flow reactor with a controlled temperature profile,
Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, Vol.34, Issue 2:3435-3443 (2013).

The sample computation is equivalent to the plot at 5 atm in Fig. 8 of the paper.
Note that x-axis of the figure is wall temperature, not gas temperature.
